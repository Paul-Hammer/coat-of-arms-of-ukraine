I found a cool design on Figma with lots of tridents. It got me thinking it would be awesome to create a website where people can make their own tridents and download them in any color or size they want. Not everyone knows about their's county coat of arms, so it'd be fine to make sections where people can read about it too. This project excites me because I use Next.js, images generation and fun animations with GSAP.

I am still creating this website, but you already can visit it and generate and download one of some tridents.
